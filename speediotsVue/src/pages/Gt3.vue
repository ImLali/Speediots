          <div class="weapon-card">
            <img src="#" alt="Mercedes AMG / BMW M4">
            <h3>The Sledgehammers</h3>
            <p>
              The front-engined beasts like the Mercedes-AMG or BMW M4. Stable, curb-devouring powerhouses with brutal
              braking performance. Predictable, confident, and dominant in long stints.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Card 2: Scalpels -->

            <h3>The Scalpels</h3>
            <p>
              The mid-engined exotics — Ferrari 296, McLaren 720S. Sharp, agile, and demanding. These cars reward
              precision driving and punish hesitation.
            </p>

            <h3>The Anomalies</h3>
            <p>
              The rear-engined icon: Porsche 992. A physics-defying machine that rockets out of corners if mastered.
              Difficult, quirky, yet devastatingly fast in the right hands.

      <!-- SIMULATOR -->
      <h2>The Simulator</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        We race in Assetto Corsa Competizione because it delivers unmatched realism. You feel the chassis flex,
        the ABS pulses, the grip evolution, and the fear when rubbered-in racing lines turn to ice in the rain.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        The track evolves dynamically — more rubber, more grip, more danger in the wet. Every lap changes.
      </p>


      <!-- EXPERIENCE -->

      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        We race hard, clean, and respectfully. Door-to-door, not bumper cars.
      </p>
