      <p class="intro">
        This is motorsport in its heaviest, loudest, and most violent form.  
        The Speediots Racing NASCAR Series is a dive into raw American horsepower:
        high speeds, tight packs, and zero electronic assistance.

      <h2>The Driving Experience</h2>
      <p>
        No ABS. No traction control. No computers.  
        Just you, a steering wheel, and a massive V8 trying to kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every moment is a battle: drafting, sliding, and wrestling a 3,400-pound stock
        car at 200 mph.
      </p>

      <h2>The Simulator</h2>
      <p>
        We race in Assetto Corsa for the most visceral stock-car physics possible.
        Heavy body roll, powerful drafting, and intense pack-racing dynamics
        make every lap a fight for survival.
      </p>

      <h2>The Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>The Trust:</strong> Pack racing demands cooperation — until it doesn’t.</p>
      <p><strong>The Physicality:</strong> Rubbing is racing. Use your bumper wisely.</p>
      <p><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Tire calls, pit gambles, and caution-flag luck decide races.</p>

      <h2>Broadcast Live</h2>
      <p>
        All Speediots NASCAR rounds are streamed live with full commentary on YouTube
        and Twitch — your chance to make a name for yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Belongs Here?</h2>
      <p>
        Drivers who want to master throttle control, tire management, and psychological
        warfare at full throttle.
      </p>

      <p><strong>The car is ready. The team is prepared. Are you?</strong></p>
