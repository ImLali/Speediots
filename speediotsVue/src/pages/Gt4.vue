      <h1>GT2 / GT4 Multiclass Championship</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        This is the hidden gem of multiclass racing. The Speediots Racing GT2/GT4 Championship breaks the mold of
        traditional endurance tiers. Instead of Prototypes and GTs, we pit raw horsepower against lightweight
        mechanical agility — creating chaotic, thrilling speed differentials on ACC’s laser-scanned tracks.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        GT2 cars are straight-line rockets that struggle in corners. GT4 cars are momentum machines that rely on
        grip and finesse. The accordion effect between the two classes creates nonstop overtaking, defending, and
        incredible racecraft.
      </p>

          Two classes, two philosophies. Will you conquer circuits with pure power or finesse?

            <h3>The Powerhouses (GT2)</h3>
            <p>
              Maserati MC20 GT2, Porsche 911 GT2 RS CS, Audi R8 LMS GT2. Over 700hp monsters with brutal acceleration
              and minimal downforce. Fastest on straights, most dangerous in corners. You are the hammer — but only if
              you can control it.
            </p>

            <h3>The Fighters (GT4)</h3>
            <p>
              Porsche Cayman, Alpine A110, BMW M4 GT4. Lightweight, momentum-based machines that reward smooth inputs.
              You cannot waste speed — every lift and every slide matters. In traffic, you fight with precision.

      <!-- SIMULATOR -->
      <h2>The Simulator</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        We race in Assetto Corsa Competizione — the perfect platform to highlight the physics differences between
        GT2 and GT4 machinery. Feel the violent throttle response of GT2 and the planted grip of GT4 in every lap.
      </p>


      <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
      <h2>The Experience</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        In GT2/GT4 racing, traffic is the name of the game. GT2s arrive fast, GT4s must stay predictable. Bravery,
        respect, and communication matter just as much as speed.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        GT4 packs form “trains” where battles last entire races. GT2 drivers must manage rear tires and throttle
        balance to survive race distance.
      </p>


      <!-- BROADCAST -->
      <h2>The World Is Watching</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Every round is streamed live on YouTube and Twitch with professional commentary. Whether you're fighting for
        a GT2 win or battling mid-pack in GT4, the world sees every move you make.
      </p>


      <!-- WHO BELONGS HERE -->
      <h2>Who Belongs Here?</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        This series is for racers who love contrasts — brute force vs precision driving. GT2 rewards throttle mastery.
        GT4 rewards consistency and close combat. The grid is waiting. Which side are you on?
