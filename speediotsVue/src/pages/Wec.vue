      <h1>WEC Championship</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        This is the main event. The Speediots Racing WEC Championship is our premier bi-weekly challenge.
        A solid 2-hour test of focus, consistency, and multiclass management. It embodies the spirit of
        Le Mans, brought to life with the precision of Le Mans Ultimate.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        This is not a sprint race. You cannot win it in the first corner — but you can easily lose it there.
        Endurance strategy, patience, and long-term pace determine the victor.
      </p>


      <!-- CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON -->
      <section class="weapon-section">
        <h2 class="weapon-title">Choose Your Weapon</h2>
        <p class="weapon-subtitle">
            Three unique classes share the same track — an ecosystem of speed and chaos. Your choice defines
        your role in the story.
        </p>

          <!-- Card 1 -->

            <img src="/src/pictures/hypercar.png" alt="Chevrolet Camaro ZL1">
            <h3>The Hypercars</h3>
            <p>
              Ferrari 499P, Toyota GR010, Porsche 963 — the fastest, most advanced race cars on earth.
        Hybrid systems, extreme downforce, and terrifying speed. You are the predator slicing through traffic.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Card 2 -->
          <div class="weapon-card">
            <img src="/src/pictures/gt2lmu.png" alt="Ford Mustang Dark Horse">
            <h3>The LMP2s</h3>
            <p>
             The Oreca 07. A brutal, equal-spec class with no electronic aids. Raw racing. Driver versus driver.
        Faster than GTs, hunted by Hypercars. Pure dogfighting.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Card 3 -->
          <div class="weapon-card">

            <h3>The LMGT3s</h3>
            <p>
              McLaren, Aston Martin, BMW. Heavier, mechanical grip–based GT machinery. You fight your own war while
        managing prototype traffic flying past you at 100 km/h closing speed.

      <!-- SIMULATOR -->
      <h2>The Simulator</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        We race in Le Mans Ultimate — the official WEC simulation built on rFactor 2 physics. Feel the real-road
        evolution, the weight difference between classes, and the fear of going offline into marbles.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        Weather, spray, visibility, and traffic shape every lap. Driving through rain at 300 km/h behind a prototype
        is a skill few ever master.
      </p>


      <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
      <h2>The Experience</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        This championship is a mental marathon. Two hours of intense focus where strategy and consistency create victory.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        Pit stops, fuel strategy, tire stints — your brain is as important as your right foot.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        Respect in traffic is everything. Blue flags are a conversation, not a command.
      </p>


      <!-- BROADCAST -->
      <h2>The World Is Watching</h2>
