# Speediots Demo Site

This is a small static demo racing site created for testing. It includes a homepage, rules, schedule and a simple registration page that stores entries in `localStorage` (demo only — no backend).

Files:
- `index.html` — main site with hero, sponsors and gallery
- `rules.html` — racing rules
- `schedule.html` — simple race day schedule
- `register.html` — registration form (client-side only)
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `scripts.js` — small JS for form handling and footer year

To view the site locally, open `index.html` in your browser or run a simple static server, e.g.: `npx http-server .` inside the `speediotsV2` folder.
